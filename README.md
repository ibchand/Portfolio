# My Portfolio Website

<p>Hello! This is the repo for my personal website which you can find here</p>
<p>I'm using MaterializeCSS for a front-end framework along with SCSS, but other than that, the site is plain HTML+CSS+JS. I want to eventually use ReactJS or Django if I decide to add a blog, but for the time being, it's just a simple portfolio site.</p>

# Credits
<p>I took a lot of inspiration from Brittany Chiang's website which you can find here: https://brittanychiang.com/</p>
<p>Reut Chen's website also helped me find a color palette. Find it here: https://www.reutchen.com/</p>
